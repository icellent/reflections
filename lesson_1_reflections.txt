The reflections.
That's great to keep all the code I had been written.
## Manual Commits
The pros is:
You can work at your own pace. and you can get fully control of your commits
The cons is:
Sometime, you may forget to commit some change
## Multi-File Commits:
Git is best for code ,coz code files always have relations
Google and etc. good for file storage. coz it doesn't care about the file relations.

## Using Git to View History
first use git log to list all of the history
second use git diff to compare the differences of the commits


## Confidence from Version Control

It's just great. You can revert to any state of you code and without loosing the current

## How do you want to use git?
integrate to my code process.
